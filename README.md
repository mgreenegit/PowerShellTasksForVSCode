# PowerShell Tasks For VSCode

When working on a project in PowerShell, if you include the *.vscode* folder from this project you will be able to run [Script Analyzer](http://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSScriptAnalyzer/1.3.0) and [Pester](http://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Pester/3.3.14) tests with minimal overhead.  For more information on either of these tools, click-through the links above to the [PowerShell Gallery](http://www.powershellgallery.com/) and click on each module page's link to the **Project Site** and review the ReadMe and/or Wiki for details.
